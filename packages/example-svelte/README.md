## About

Asynchronous state management in Svelte made simple.

Qwery provides the structure required to manage and build relationships between asynchronous state while taking care of stabilizing object references and keeping the cache (if any) up to date.

It also enables an environment agnostic approach to managing asynchronous state allowing simpler migrations between different frontend frameworks and backend architectural styles such as monolith to microservices and REST to GraphQL.
